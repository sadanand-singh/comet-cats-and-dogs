# Experiments on cats vs dogs data using comet.ml for tracking

This is a sample code base for training models in pytorch. This is for demonstrating management of
deep learning experiments via [comet.ml](https://www.comet.ml/).

I have used this repository for [my blog post](https://datasciencevision.com/deep-learning-management/)
on the topic of experiment management and transfer learning.

This along with the blog post should be of interest to you if are intersted in either transfer
learning or management of deep learning experiments in general.

The code structure here is based on [this template](https://github.com/victoresque/pytorch-template).
